# Reactive

According to [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) a reactive system is:

1. Responsive: should respond in timely manner
1. Message Driven: Asynchronous messages should be passed between components to ensure loose coupling, isolation and location transparency
1. Elastic: still responsive under high load
1. Reslilient: still responsive when some components fail
