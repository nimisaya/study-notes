# Collection of Study Notes

## Overview

Interested in learning a variety of programming topics? Keen on mobile app development (Android and iOS)? This repo contains a collection of notes based on concepts I come across at work, on my own projects or through self-study. 

## Link

No link as of yet. For now just go to the folder of the topic you are interested in and click on the relevant document e.g. Android > RxJava.md. I might one day make it a mkdocs site or something but since it is just meant to be unpolished notes I probably won't.

## Tech

Written in markdown. The tech covered will vary but most likely be focused on Android and iOS.
